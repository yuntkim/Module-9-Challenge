# Module-9-Challenge
SQL 
## Background
It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

## Before You Begin
1. Create a new repository for this project called sql-challenge. ### Do not add this assignment to an existing repository.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local Git repository, create a directory for this Challenge. Use a folder name that corresponds to the Challenge, such as EmployeeSQL.

4. Note that you’ll add your files to this folder and push the changes to GitHub.
